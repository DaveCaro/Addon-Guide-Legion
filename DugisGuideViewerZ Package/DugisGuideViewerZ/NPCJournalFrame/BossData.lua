Players must try to avoid damage from these, as this should be a low-damage period to allow healers to catch up on tank and raid healing.<br/><br/>(npc:76877) also attacks the tanks with (spell:155078), which deals heavy damage to all players within 10 yards and leaves them more vulnerable to further (spell:155078) damage. Tanks must make sure that this attack does not happen while (npc:76877) is faced into the raid for (spell:155080); by taunting quickly or rapidly moving to drag (npc:76877) away from the raid as soon as (spell:155080) occurs.<br/><br/>Finally, (npc:76877) will frequently cause (spell:173192) near random players in the room, causing a small zone of lingering AoE damage. Players must move out of the (spell:173192) without jeopardizing their ability to soak (spell:155080).| |DPS|<b>Use DPS cooldowns at the start of the encounter; movement becomes more hectic later on<br/><b>Stack on or near other players in your assigned location to ensure you split (spell:155080) damage<br/><b>Move away from (spell:173192) locations<br/><b>Sidestep (spell:155301)<br/><b>If affected by (spell:155330), move away from other players to avoid spreading (spell:155530) damage| |TANK|<b>Typically keep (npc:76877) faced away from the raid to prevent excessive (spell:155078) damage<br/><b>Face (npc:76877) towards a group of players for (spell:155080), and be sure to alternate groups for each cast of (spell:155080)<br/><b>Tanks should taunt off one another at 2-3 stacks of Inferno Strike initially, then after (spell:155078) falls off thereafter<br/><b>Use strong survivability cooldowns for late applications of (spell:155078), when stacks are high<br/><b>Move out of (spell:155301), particularly during (spell:155539)<br/><b>If affected by (spell:155330), move away from other players to avoid spreading (spell:155530) damage| |HEAL|<b>The (spell:155080) group will take heavy damage as Slice occurs, and lingering DoT damage after; be sure to top players up before their next (spell:155080) soak<br/><b>Tanks will take increasingly heavy damage leading up to (spell:155539), and may need CDs when their (spell:155078) stacks are high<br/><b>Players struck by (spell:155301) or (spell:173192) will take heavy damage and will need emergency healing<br/><b>Players who do not spread out properly for (spell:155330) will inflict heavy damage on all nearby allies<br/><b>Damage reduction CDs should be used to mitigate (spell:155080), especially if there is a mistake and one group takes two in a row<br/><b>Healing throughput CDs should be used to top players up after (spell:155330) or (spell:155539) before the next (spell:155080), or to recover from a failed (spell:155330)<br/><b>Stack on or near other players in your assigned location to ensure you split (spell:155080) damage<br/><b>Move away from (spell:173192) locations<br/><b>Sidestep (spell:155301)<br/><b>If affected by (spell:155330), move away from other players to avoid spreading (spell:155530) damage|

It is a hectic fight, and (spell:2825)/(spell:32182)/(spell:80353) may be more useful here than on the final boss of the dungeon.<br/><br/>Throughout the fight, two (npc:101075) adds will drop down from the gallery above the encounter area, and begin mindlessly moving toward Naraxas.<br/><br/>Naraxas will periodically affect two non-tank players with (spell:205549).<br/><br/>The pools from (spell:205549) will heavily slow the (npc:101075) adds that pass through them, and apply a DoT that helps the party kill them.<br/><br/>Additional party damage comes from frequent (spell:210150) casts, which apply (spell:217851) to players. Classes that can remove Poison (Druid, Monk, Paladin) should do so, and healers should prioritize removing the tank's debuff.<br/><br/>When Naraxas reaches full mana, approximately 50 seconds into the fight, she will attack the tank with (spell:199176). During (spell:199176), Naraxas will draw the tank toward her, trying to suck the player into her maw. Just like with the (npc:101075) adds, the (spell:205549) puddles will also slow the rate at which Naraxas pulls the tank into her mouth.<br/><br/>Note that when (spell:199705) finishes, the tank may not be within melee range of Naraxas, and she may attack a melee DPS. The tank should taunt Naraxas quickly after (spell:199705) fades.<br/><br/>As with the (npc:101075) (spell:209902) mechanic, each time Naraxas casts (spell:199705) she gains a stack of (spell:199246).<br/><br/>Note that if Naraxas has no players within melee range, she will begin to cast (spell:198963). <br/><br/>Naraxas will (spell:199775) when she falls below 20% health, increasing her attack speed and her Physical damage dealt. If Naraxas is casting (spell:199705) when she reaches 20% health, she will immediately cancel the cast and begin attacking targets within her melee range. It is important for tanks to use the (spell:205549) to stop the (spell:199705)'s forced movement, so they can stay within melee range and be able to quickly taunt Naraxas when this occurs.<br/><br/>When Naraxas is defeated, her corpse falls back down the hole into the cavern below.

The second phase, (spell:203935), occurs when (npc:98208) reaches 50% health, and will teleport players away from the boss to another location in the dungeon.

This damage increases by 1% every 3 seconds, as (npc:99865) accumulates stacks of (spell:195034). Players must solve the Lens puzzle quickly to avoid being overwhelmed by the (spell:195032) damage.<br/><br/>Note that pre-existing (spell:214893) orbs will continue to bounce around the room during this phase; players should be careful with their positioning and movement.<br/><br/>Once the Lens puzzle has been completed, (npc:99865) will return to using (spell:214893) and (spell:194945). The party should use its most powerful damage-dealing cooldowns immediately to take advantaged of (npc:99865)'s (spell:194333) vulnerability.<br/><br/>Subsequent (spell:194323) phases will occur 55 seconds after players have completed the previous (spell:194323)'s Lens puzzle.

When he casts (spell:227568), the melee DPS and tanks should run out to the ranged and stand near them. (npc:114261) will then use (spell:227453) and place all the (spell:227480)s clumped together. The party then moves away in one direction, and the tank resets (npc:114261) to a safe distance from the ranged.<br/><br/>The (npc:114265)s use a single ability, (spell:227325), which they will cast every 10 seconds.<br/><br/>The strategy listed above should keep all of the (npc:114265)s close together most of the time so they can be AoEd.<br/><br/>When a (npc:114265)'s health is reduced to 0, they retire to the side of the stage and begin to dance. They will no longer use (spell:227325). The party should kill (npc:114265)s first, quickly, to reduce the damage of this phase.<br/><br/>Phase 2: The Fins<br/><br/>When (npc:114261) reaches 50% health, he will retire to the side of the stage with his dancing (npc:114265)s, and will begin to dance as well. (npc:114260) and her three (npc:114266) adds will then advance from the other side of the stage.<br/><br/>(npc:114260) uses powerful water- and storm-based abilities against the party.<br/><br/>About every 23 seconds, (npc:114260) will cast (spell:227783), summoning powerful waves that sweep across the stage.<br/><br/>Players will often have to deal with both (spell:227783) and (spell:227777) at the same time. This can lead to fatal damage if a player is struck by a wave just as their (spell:227777) is expiring.<br/><br/>In addition, the three (npc:114266) adds will frequently cast (spell:227420).<br/><br/>(spell:227420) can be interrupted and the (npc:114266)s are susceptible to AoE CC and stuns. As with the (npc:114265)s in phase 1, reducing the (npc:114266)s' health to zero will cause them to retreat to the side of the stage and dance, removing (spell:227420) from the encounter.<br/><br/>Players should focus on killing the (npc:114266)s first, and expect to spend a long time in this phase as the heavy movement requirements of (spell:227777) and (spell:227783) will limit DPS uptime on (npc:114260).<br/><br/>Phase 3: Somewhere<br/><br/>Once (npc:114260) is brought to 50% health, (npc:114261) will re-join the battle, and players must deal with both (npc:114260) and (npc:114261)'s abilities<br/><br/>The encounter area will quickly fill up with (spell:227480)s that can restrict the party's ability to react to (spell:227777) or (spell:227783). Continue to use the positioning from phase 2, since (spell:227783) and (spell:227777) are more potent, and more likely to be fatal. Tanks and melee must be sure to run out for (spell:227568), as a stun during (spell:227777) or (spell:227783) may cause a wipe.<br/><br/>Use (spell:2825)/(spell:32182)/(spell:80353) for this phase to shorten it.<br/><br/>Both (npc:114261) and (npc:114260) must die for the encounter to end. The two bosses' health pools are not linked. Players should focus on killing one of the two bosses first to remove their abilities from the encounter; (npc:114260) is the most dangerous and should be the primary target.<br/><br/>(npc:114260) will become stunned when reduced to 0 health, while (npc:114261) will actually die - as in West Side Story - and it is his body that drops loot.| |DPS|<b>In phases 1 and 2, prioritize the (npc:114265)s and (npc:114266) adds above the bosses<br/><b>Ranged DPS should stand out of (spell:227568) range, and melee DPS should run out when (npc:114261) casts it<br/><b>Move away from nearby (spell:227480)s<br/><b>Move away from other players when (spell:227777) is about to expire<br/><b>Avoid the (spell:227783) waves and the (spell:227420) bubbles<br/><b>Ranged DPS should stand near the front of the stage during phase 2, and aim (spell:227420) bubbles away from the melee<br/><b>Use (spell:2825)/(spell:32182)/(spell:80353) during phase 3 and focus on killing (npc:114260) first| |HEAL|<b>Dispel the (spell:227568) DoT off of any players affected by it<br/><b>Move out of (spell:227568) range, and step away from nearby (spell:227480)s<br/><b>Top up players before their (spell:227777) debuff expires<br/><b>Move away from other players when (spell:227777) is about to expire<br/><b>Avoid the (spell:227783) waves and the (spell:227420) bubbles<br/><b>Stand near the front of the stage to aim (spell:227420) bubbles away from melee<br/><b>Use cooldowns during phase 3, when the fight is the most hectic<br/><b>Any players (spell:227567) during phase 3 will likely require emergency healing| |TANK|<b>Use AoE CC and stuns on the (npc:114265)s and (npc:114266) adds when possible<br/><b>Run away from (npc:114261) during (spell:227568)<br/><b>Move (npc:114261) away from the (spell:227480)s that spawn following (spell:227453)<br/><b>When debuffed with (spell:227777), move away from nearby players if necessary<br/><b>Avoid the (spell:227783) waves and the (spell:227420) bubbles<br/><b>Use cooldowns while both bosses are active|

However, he retains (spell:229287), which he will use every 20 seconds. This is more dangerous on the Command Ship's deck, as space is more limited.<br/><br/>When (npc:114790) lands on the Command Ship, he will begin to cast (spell:229151) repeatedly until players, who land on the opposite end of the deck, engage him.<br/><br/>The sides of the Command Ship deck are fortified with four Legion Soul Harvesters, each of which fires fel lightning in a short radius from its position.<br/><br/>Once players reach (npc:114790), they do not have to worry about Legion Soul Harvesters anymore, and can focus on dodging (spell:229287) and handling the core mechanics of the fight.<br/><br/>Note that during Phase 2, (spell:229159) will affect 2 targets each time it is applied. Healers should dispel one target quickly, and let the second debuff expire, so that players are not dodging two waves of (spell:229161) at once.<br/><br/>When (npc:114790) reaches 30% health, he will summon another (spell:229610) and teleport to the deck of the final Legion Command Ship.<br/><br/>Phase 3: The Rift!<br/><br/>When (npc:114790) reaches the second Legion Command Ship, he will begin to cast (spell:230084), which has a 30-second cast time.<br/><br/>The only obstacle to reaching (npc:114790) in time to interrupt (spell:230084) is that the deck of the second Command Ship is lined with 6 (npc:115730) adds.<br/><br/>Even if players interupt the (spell:230084) cast, waves of 2 (npc:115730) adds will continue to spawn every 25 seconds. The first wave of these will appear shortly after players engage (npc:114790), and should be killed. Players can determine whether they need to kill the next set or can safely focus the boss.<br/><br/>(npc:114790) will use neither (spell:229287) nor (spell:229248) during this phase, so players must only handle the core mechanics.<br/><br/>Note that (spell:229159) will affect three targets each time it is cast in this phase.| |DPS|<b>If targeted by (spell:229159), quickly move away from other players, and once dispelled, do not move into your (spell:229161) orbs<br/><b>Interrupt (spell:229083) to help the tank's (spell:229083) DoT stacks fall off<br/><b>Move out of the path of (spell:229151) and incoming (spell:229161) orbs<br/><b>During Phase 1, if targeted by (spell:229241)/(spell:229248), run out to the edge of the platform and overlap the (spell:229250) as much as possible<br/><b>During Phases 1 and 2, avoid standing in the (spell:229287) impact zones<br/><b>Take the (spell:229610) to the Legion ship on each phase transition<br/><b>At the start of Phase 2, assess the direction of (npc:114790)'s (spell:229151) casts and duck into the sides of the ship if necessary to avoid them<br/><b>Interrupt (spell:230084) at the start of Phase 3<br/><b>In Phase 3, use efficient cleave/AoE to kill the (npc:115730) adds, but the primary DPS target should still be (npc:114790)| |HEAL|<b>Dispel (spell:229159) from its target once the player runs away from others<br/><b>If (spell:229159) isn't imminent, dispel (spell:229083) from the tank, especially if it reaches 3 or more stacks<br/><b>Players targeted by (spell:229248) or (spell:229159), or struck by (spell:229151) or (spell:229287), will require heavy healing<br/><b>When multiple targets are affected by (spell:229159), dispel one quickly (a melee target is best) and let the other ones expire<br/><b>Move out of the path of (spell:229161) and (spell:229151)<br/><b>Avoid standing in the (spell:229287) impact zones<br/><b>When targeted by (spell:229241)/(spell:229248), run to the edge of the platform and drop the (spell:229250) as close together as possible<br/><b>Take the (spell:229610) to the Legion ship on each phase transition<br/><b>At the start of Phase 2, assess the direction of (npc:114790)'s (spell:229151) casts and duck into the sides of the ship if necessary to avoid them<br/><b>During Phase 3, the tank will require heavy healing, especially when (npc:115730) are active<br/><b>Dispel the (spell:229083) and (spell:230002) debuffs from the tank between (spell:229159) casts| |TANK|<b>Tank (npc:114790) in the center of the encounter space<br/><b>Interrupt (spell:229083)<br/><b>Use cooldowns if you reach 3+ stacks of the (spell:229083) DoT or if you are targeted by (spell:229159)<br/><b>Move out of the path of (spell:229151) and incoming (spell:229161) orbs<br/><b>During Phases 1 and 2, avoid standing in the (spell:229287) impact zones<br/><b>Take the (spell:229610) to the Legion Command Ship on each phase transition<br/><b>At the start of Phase 2, assess the direction of (npc:114790)'s (spell:229151) casts and step onto the sides of the ship if necessary to avoid them<br/><b>Try to be the first player to reach (npc:114790) in Phase 2<br/><b>At the start of Phase 3, drag the 6 (npc:115730) to the boss<br/><b>Pick up the two new (npc:115730) that spawn shortly after arriving and again every 25 seconds|

|BOSSID|102263| |LVL|110| |NAME|Skorpyron| |MAPID|1088| |ST|This encounter is primarily single-target with several waves of numerous low-health adds. One tank should primarily focus on tanking (npc:102263), while another tank should be designated to pick up these adds.<br/><br/>Throughout the fight, the raid will gradually whittle away (npc:102263)'s armor until he is briefly unprotected, and then will deal extra damage until (npc:102263) recovers. Players should save their DPS cooldowns for these vulnerability phases, which occur at 75%, 50%, and 25% health.<br/><br/>Dozens of (npc:103217)s patrol around the edge of (npc:102263)'s encounter area, (spell:212229) from attacks.

Aim to keep the entire raid within the decorative circle for the entirety of the encounter.<br/><br/>If players position themselves to avoid pulling (npc:103217)s, then they will only have to deal with these adds each time (npc:102263) casts (spell:204372).<br/><br/>As (npc:103217)s in the room are pulled and killed, new (npc:103217)s will file in periodically through the crystal-lined breech in the wall opposite the entrance to the room. Players must take special care not to stand in this area, or else all of these new (npc:103217)s will be engaged, and will likely kill any player near them before the adds tank can get them under control.<br/><br/>The phase-like flow of the encounter arises from (npc:102263)'s (spell:206947), which players must break through in order to deal more damage to the boss.<br/><br/>Players should save their DPS cooldowns for the periods of (spell:204459). Because the final phase is the most difficult, since (npc:102263) has 2 stacks of (spell:205947), the raid should save (spell:2825)/(spell:32182)/(spell:80353) for the (spell:204459) at 25% health.<br/><br/>In addition, each time the raid deals 2.5% of (npc:102263)'s health in damage, a (spell:204292) will break off of the (spell:206947), forming a (npc:103209).<br/><br/>After each (spell:204459) phase, (npc:102263) will fire off a rapid succession of (spell:204292) to "catch up" to the boss's health. Healers should be prepared to use raid CDs to recover from this damage.<br/><br/>(npc:102263) slowly gains energy through the course of the encounter. At full Energy, he will cast (spell:210074); this occurs approximately every minute.<br/><br/>Players can avoid taking (spell:210074) damage and getting knocked back by using a (npc:103209) to block LOS.<br/><br/>Note that standing behind a (npc:103209) does not prevent you from attacking the boss (unless you are out of range, of course) or healing other players.

|BOSSID|104415| |LVL|110| |NAME|Chronomatic Anomaly| |MAPID|1088| |ST|This fight requires players to burst down priority targets about every minute, and then to quickly kill a small handful of mobs. The encounter has moderate to heavy movement requirements and requires interrupts and AoE CC for the small mob spawns.<br/><br/>The Nightwell has distorted the (spell:205653) in the areas around it, causing fluctuation in the speed at which time passes. This mechanic breaks the fight into phases, each one characterized by the speed of time:<br/><b>(spell:207012) has no effect on players, and is the phase that the fight will begin in<br/><b>(spell:207011) slows the rate of time by 30%, causing players to move and attack 30% slower, and also affecting cooldown recovery rate<br/><b>(spell:207013) increases the rate of time by 30%, causing players to move and attack 30% faster, and also affecting cooldown recovery rate<br/><br/>(spell:207011) and (spell:207013) also affect the abilities that (npc:104415) will cast. These differences will be mentioned in each spell's specific section in this guide.<br/><br/>The fight is unique in that (npc:104415) will use these abiilities in a different order on each difficulty. Even within the same difficulty, (npc:104415) will use his abilities at different times and in different orders in each phase. Because of this, there is no real way to list most of the spell cooldowns and frequencies here; consult a boss mod if you require more details on timing.<br/><br/>The first four phases are triggered by using the (spell:212115)/(spell:219823) interaction; the time speed will shift immediately when the tank interrupts (spell:219823). Subsequent phases become uncoupled from this interaction, making the fight feel very unpredictable.<br/><br/>After 7 minutes, (npc:104415) will enrage and cast (spell:207976), if he isn't dead by this point the raid will wipe very quickly.<br/><br/>Occasionally, a (npc:104676) will spill out of the Nightwell and spawn an add. The (npc:104676) is a priority DPS target, and the raid should switch to it quickly.<br/><br/>Note that during (spell:207013), (npc:104676)s are very likely to successfully cast (spell:207228). Healers may wish to use CDs during this time to help the raid survive.<br/><br/>When a (npc:104676) dies, it will spawn 4 (npc:114671)s at its location.<br/><br/>A minute into each of the first four phases, and occasionally thereafter, (npc:104415) will turn to the Nightwell and begin to channel (spell:219823) from it.<br/><br/>(spell:212076)s are spawned whenever a (npc:104676) is killed.<br/><br/>It is important to kill (npc:104676)s as quickly as possible, so that the (spell:212076) forms with enough time to interrupt (spell:219823).<br/><br/>In some phases, (npc:104676)s spawn late, leaving little time between the time it spawns and the time that (npc:104415) channels his (spell:219823). Healers should use CDs to help survive the initial (spell:219823) ticks until the (spell:212115) ability can be used.<br/><br/>For 15 seconds after the (spell:212115) is used, (npc:104415) takes 30% increased damage. Players should save their DPS cooldowns for these moments. <br/><br/>(spell:2825)/(spell:32182)/(spell:80353) may be best used to help quickly burn down a late-spawning (npc:104676), and then to deal additional damage to (npc:104415) while he is vulnerable.<br/><br/>Periodically, (npc:104415) will choose a random player and plant a (spell:206617) on them.<br/><br/>Players affected by (spell:206617) should run away from the raid when their debuff is close to expiring, to reduce the damage dealt.<br/><br/>The duration of the (spell:206617) debuff is random, but is affected by the (spell:205653).<br/><br/>Targeted players should wait until they have less than 8 seconds left on their debuff before running out; when this debuff is applied during the (spell:207013) phase, they should run out immediately. The (spell:206617) debuff will cause a frequent pulsing effect at the player's feet when it is nearing expiration, to help you remember to run!<br/><br/>(spell:206612) is a simple mechanic; (npc:104415) will mark the floor at several random players' feet, and then launch a projectile at those locations. This occurs in three rapid waves, and each wave consists of 5 projectiles.<br/><br/>Players should move away in order to avoid taking damage from the (spell:206612). The phase of the fight determines how long players have to dodge these projectiles<br/><br/>Once or twice per phase, (npc:104415) will cause (spell:205707) to spill from the Nightwell. Several waves of projectiles will be emitted from the Nightwell and fly outward in straight lines to the edge of the room. Players who stand in (spell:205707) will take moderate damage. This can quickly add up to fatal damage if players are struck by several (spell:205707) in a short window of time.<br/><br/>The speed at which the (spell:205707) move is dictated by the (spell:205653), with (spell:207011) causing extremely slow orbs and (spell:207013) causing extremely fast ones.<br/><br/>In addition, the waves themselves move at different speeds, so there will sometimes be places in the room where the (spell:205707) present an unbroken line and players will be unable to dodge all of them. This position is different in each phase.<br/><br/>Avoid as many (spell:205707) as possible. During the (spell:207013) phase, healers may wish to use cooldowns to help the raid survive, as many of the orbs may be moving too quickly to easily dodge.<br/><br/>During each phase, (npc:104415) will debuff players with (spell:206609). This applies a healing absorption shield to the targeted players.<br/><br/>The number of targets, frequency of cast, size of the absorption shield, and duration of the debuff are all dependent upon the (spell:205653).<br/><br/>(npc:104415) will afflict his current target with (spell:206607) every 5-6 seconds. This is the tank-swap mechanic in the encounter.<br/><br/>The duration of (spell:206607) and the speed at which they tick is dependent upon the (spell:205653).<br/><br/>Phase changes may also alter existing (spell:206607) durations, increasing or decreasing the time remaining on the debuff.<br/><br/>During (spell:207011), tanks will likely need to take 9 stacks of the debuff before taunt swapping, and will be taking very heavy damage. Save heavy cooldowns for these times; healers should also be prepared to pay extra attention to tank healing.<br/><br/>(npc:104415) will not cast (spell:206607) while he is channelling (spell:219823), which can give tanks a break to reset stacks, especially during (spell:207011).| |DPS|<b>Save DPS cooldowns to help kill late-spawning (npc:104676)s or for the boss's vulnerability after each (spell:212115)<br/><b>Move toward the (npc:104676) when it begins to form<br/><b>Prioritize killing the (npc:104676) over dealing damage to (npc:104415)<br/><b>Quickly burst down the (npc:114671)s<br/><b>Interrupt (spell:207228) when possible<br/><b>Use AoE stuns and other CC to prevent (npc:114671)s from casting<br/><b>If targeted by (spell:206617), run away from the raid when the debuff begins pulsating/has fewer than 8 seconds remaining<br/><b>Move away from (spell:206612) and (spell:205707) zones| |HEAL|<b>Use healing cooldowns whenever (npc:104415) begins channeling (spell:219823) before the (npc:104676) dies<br/><b>Use healing cooldowns during (spell:205707) in the (spell:207013) phase<br/><b>Use a minor healing cooldown during the whole-raid (spell:206609) that occurs during (spell:207011) phases<br/><b>Prioritize healing players with red (spell:206609) debuffs over those with yellow or green debuffs<br/><b>Heavy tank healing will be needed during (spell:207011) when the tanks reach high stacks of (spell:206607)<br/><b>If targeted by (spell:206617), run away from the raid when the debuff begins pulsating/has fewer than 8 seconds remaining<br/><b>Move away from (spell:206612) and (spell:205707) zones| |TANK|<b>Taunt-swap the boss before either tank reaches 10 stacks of (spell:206607)<br/><b>Swap after 5-6 stacks during (spell:207012)<br/><b>Swap after 3 stacks during (spell:207013)<br/><b>Swap on 9 stacks during (spell:207011), and use cooldowns to survive<br/><b>Use Active Mitigation while tanking (npc:104415) with several stacks of (spell:206607)<br/><b>Move the boss over to the (npc:104676) for cleave and splash AoE damage<br/><b>When the (spell:212076) spawns, interact with it to gain (spell:212099)<br/><b>When (npc:104415) casts (spell:219823), the tank with (spell:212099) should approach the boss to interrupt it<br/><b>Interrupt (spell:207228) when possible<br/><b>Use AoE stuns and other CC to prevent (npc:114671)s from casting<br/><b>Move away from (spell:206612) and (spell:205707) zones|

|BOSSID|101002| |LVL|110| |NAME|Krosus| |MAPID|1088| |ST|This encounter is a single-phase fight with a hard "enrage" at 6 minutes, as (npc:101002) will destroy a quarter of the bridge players are fighting him on every 90 seconds. Most of the fight is single-target, but every 90 seconds (npc:101002) will summon a small number of adds that must be killed.<br/><br/>Note that players can walk right off the front of the bridge during the fight. These players will die, and you may struggle to reach them with battle resurrection effects. Take care in positioning, especially with (spell:100)-like effects.<br/><br/>(npc:101002) will cast (spell:205875) every 30 seconds, raising his fists high into the air and then smashing them with great force into the bridge.<br/><br/>(npc:101002) strikes the bridge with such force that the structure will begin to deteriorate. The second (spell:205875) will cause the front quarter of the bridge to fracture, and the third (spell:205875) will destroy the fractured area.<br/><br/>This creates a 6-minute hard "enrage". The raid must defeat (npc:101002) before the 12th (spell:205875) cast.<br/><br/>It is not possible for tanks to soak the third (spell:205875), as to do so would require them to stand on the bridge segment that is being destroyed, and they would fall into the ocean and die.

This will lead to increased raid damage from (spell:205348) during the later stages of the fight.<br/><br/>This spell is used erratically; the first one occurs early in the fight, and there can be a gap of up to a minute before the next (spell:205348) is cast. Later in the encounter, (npc:101002) may cast (spell:205348) as frequently as every 15 seconds. Players must remain alert and ready to run if targeted, and healers should use cooldowns to recover from more frequent (spell:205348) barrages.<br/><br/>Frequently, (npc:101002) will attack the raid with (spell:205391). This ability is not on a strict timer; it happens erratically throughout the fight.<br/><br/>Dodging the (spell:205391) can be more difficult for players who are running out with (spell:205348) or who are attacking (npc:104262)s.

|BOSSID|110965| |LVL|110| |NAME|Elisande| |MAPID|1088| |ST|This encounter features heavy movement and frequent high-priority target swaps. The fight has a three-phase structure, and (npc:110965) uses more complex abilities in later phases.<br/><br/>(npc:110965) will begin the encounter by casting (spell:208865), dealing damage to nearby players as she lands. <br/><br/>Players must bring (npc:110965) to 10% health to initiate a new phase. When this happens, (npc:110965) will cast (spell:208944) and disappear into the Nightwell, healing to full health. After 10 seconds, she will (spell:208865) and begin the next phase.<br/><br/>Each phase gets progressively harder because, when (npc:110965) uses certain abilities ((spell:233066) on Normal and (spell:228877), (spell:210024) on Heroic), she leaves behind an (npc:105622) at her position that will cast those abilities again in subsequent phases.<br/><br/>The (npc:110965) encounter can be a long fight. Depending on your raid's performance, it may be possible to get two casts of (spell:2825)/(spell:32182)/(spell:80353) - one at the start of the encounter, and again during the third and hardest phase. A raid that will get only one cast of (spell:2825)/(spell:32182)/(spell:80353) will have to decide between using it during Phase 1, to reduce the number of (spell:228877) casts that will be echoed later, or during Phase 3, where the fight is the most difficult.<br/><br/>All Phases<br/><br/><b>At varying intervals throughout the fight, (npc:110965) will summon Time Elementals to assist her.

All players should try and maintain the (spell:209166) buff on themselves as much as possible, whilst players should generally avoid taking the (spell:209165) zone debuff. Instead, players should try and be near the (spell:209165) zone to help deal with incoming abilities.<br/><br/>Recursive and (npc:105301)s will spawn at the same, or similar, times in each phase.

This ability deals moderate damage to its target, and then lashes out to additional players. As a phase progresses, (spell:229738) will target fewer additional players, reducing the healing requirements to deal with this mechanic.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Time Layer 1<br/><br/><b>During the first phase, (npc:110965) will use (spell:228877) and (spell:233066). (spell:233066) patches will echo into future phases, so reducing the number (spell:233066) casts that can occur in Phase 1, by using (spell:209166) as a DPS boost and by using (spell:2825)/(spell:32182)/(spell:80353), makes subsequent phases less difficult.<br/><b>About 30-40 seconds into the phase, (npc:110965) will teleport to a random location in the room and cast (spell:228877).

|BOSSID|103769| |LVL|110| |NAME|Xavius| |MAPID|1094| |ST|This encounter has three phases, initiated when (npc:103769) falls beneath certain health thresholds (Phase 2 begins at 65% health, and Phase 3 begins at 30% health).<br/><br/><b>Each phase has a different set of mechanics that players must master<br/><b>Once consistent mechanic is that, each time (npc:103769) reaches 100 Energy, he will summon adds<br/><b>Some of these adds are high-priority burst targets, particularly during Phase 1 and 2<br/><b>These adds are infrequent and players will spend most of their time DPSing (npc:103769)<br/><br/>Three tanks are recommended for this encounter. It is possible to do with only two tanks, and many groups do, but having three tanks will smooth out certain mechanics and may help the raid progress further into the fight. As always, evaluate your own raid's strengths and weaknesses when determining how many players of each role to bring to an encounter.<br/><br/>Corruption Mechanics<br/><br/><b>When the encounter begins, players will be given an Alternate Power Bar to track their Corruption levels. Corruption is gained from several of (npc:103769)'s abilities, and at certain thresholds, players will begin to 'hallucinate' new mechanics that only they can see or be affected by. It is important to avoid gaining Corruption at too fast a rate, as these additional mechanics deal heavy damage on top of the already hectic fight.<br/><b>At 33 Corruption or higher, players will see (npc:105343)s appear in the shadows at the edges of the encounter area.<br/><br/><b>The (npc:105343)s will cast (spell:208860) about every 10 seconds<br/><b>This creates a large pink circle where the Abomination will smash its limb into the ground<br/><b>Players at the center of the circle (near the edge of the encounter area) will take extremely high damage<br/><b>The damage is reduced the further away you are from the center<br/><b>The range is massive, so you cannot fully outrange the ability<br/><b>Run as far away from the center of the AoE as is feasible<br/><br/><b>At 66 Corruption or higher, players will be affected by (spell:206879).<br/><b>When a player reaches 100 Corruption, they will gain the (spell:208431) buff.<br/><br/><b>For 20 seconds, the player's damage and healing is increased by 150%<br/><b>When this buff wears off, the player gains (spell:207409), and becomes mind-controlled<br/><b>The mind-controlled player transforms into a (npc:110732), and will attack players with (spell:225903)<br/><b>The mind-controlled player's health is increased by 150%<br/><b>Creatures of Madness are immune to all CCs except stuns<br/><br/><b>A player who transforms into a (npc:110732) must be killed, taking valuable DPS and resources away from managing (npc:103769) and his mechanics, as well as increasing the likelihood that other players will become mind-controlled.<br/><b>Note that battle resurrections do not clear a player's Corruption. This means that, if you battle res a player who was mind-controlled, they will pop up with full Corruption and immediately enter (spell:208431). Battle resses should not be used on players who die to this mechanic early in the fight, as the raid will simply have to kill them again soon.<br/><br/>The Dream<br/><br/><b>Fortunately, players are not alone in their fight against (npc:103769). The (npc:105245) will spawn twice during the encounter and send half of the party into the Dream, allowing them extra leeway in managing their Corruption.<br/><b>While in the Dream, players' bodies are unconscious, but the players may still interact in the encounter as a (spell:206005) version of themselves.<br/><b>The (spell:206005) will last for 3 minutes or until:<br/><br/><b>The player takes "fatal" damage<br/><b>The player reaches 100 Corruption, and would become mind-controlled<br/><b>In the latter case, the player will benefit fully from the 20-second (spell:208431) buff<br/><br/><b>(spell:206005) players should assist the raid by performing tasks or soaking mechanics that cause Corruption gain, "shielding" the raid from that Corruption.<br/><br/><b>Dreaming tanks should taunt the (npc:103695) or taunt (npc:103769) during (spell:209443)<br/><b>Dreaming healers should be the primary dispellers of tank debuffs<br/><b>Dreaming players should intercept (npc:103694)s, soak (spell:206369)s, and absorb (spell:208385) pools<br/><b>For more information on these mechanics, see the Phase 1 and Phase 2 sections below<br/><br/><b>The goal within the Dream is to protect the raid as much as possible from Corruption gains, and to prolong your stay in the Dream so that you will reach 100 Corruption and gain the (spell:208431) throughput buff. Use cooldowns liberally to help defeat adds or heal through heavy raid damage.<br/><b>When players enter the Dream, they are set to zero Corruption. However, upon leaving the Dream, players are set back to the Corruption levels they had before the Dream began.<br/><b>While in the Dream, players are vulnerable to the Corruption threshold mechanics listed above, and are very likely to see them since they are soaking Corruption mechanics.

The breath will also cause 5 (npc:116195) adds to spawn.<br/><b>When the (spell:230229) comes in, you want to face it to one side of the platform whilst making sure not to face it too far away from the encounter area, as otherwise the (npc:116195)s will spawn on top of the elevated platforms.
