### Changed

Zygor Viewer Guide :

- GENERAL : 

Enhanced support with World Quest Tracker addon.

Note: If a quest is already being tracked in WQT and you click the icon to load the guide for it the first click will actually remove it from WQT and not jump to the guide. You will need to click the icon a second time to re-add it to WQT and load the guide.

- LEVELING :

Added in the Heros call/warchiefs quest for swamp of sorrows into the swamp of sorrows guide, and removed the turnin for "Not Fireflies, Flameflies" as it is turned in already in a previous guide for Horde.

- WORLD QUESTS :

Additional world quests added.

- DUNGEONS :

Updates to Classic dungeons in response to Blizzard disabling Waypoint Arrows in them. Better pathing directions being added in to navigate players via text.

- OPTIONS : 

Additional options added for Guide Viewer, Waypoint Arrow, and text sizing.
