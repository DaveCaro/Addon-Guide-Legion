-NEW FEATURES :

Map Preview - Due to Blizzard disabling the ability to detect player location in dungeons the arrow now gets replaced with a map icon that when clicked will open a special version of the map that allows you to see your characters position, waypoint makers to guide locations, and ant trails for navigation. This map can be fully customized to your liking under Options / Navigation - Map Preview section.

Guide Tip Sharing - You can now share the dungeon guide tips and strategies with the members of your group/party to make sure everyone knows what to do.
