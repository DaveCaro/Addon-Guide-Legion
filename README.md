Hey 

I opened this Git to release to everybody some Paid Addon in World Of Warcraft. Here you will find some suites like : Zygor, Dugi or Dynasty.

###Installation  
* Copy DugisGuideViewerZ or ZygorGuidesViewer to your World of Warcraft folder(WoW\Interface\AddOns\PLACE THEM HERE)
* For Dynasty you need to go inside the folder and copy all folders to your World Of Warcraft Folder (See Below)
* Put these files  in `...C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft` Or where ever you have your World of Warcraft installed.
* Also, make sure the game is closed when moving new files into the addon directory as it is unable to discover new files when it's already running.

###Hope you enjoy these addon for any problems you can contact me here :
